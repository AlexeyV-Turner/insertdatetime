# larrydanna.insertdatetime

## Insert Date Time
Remember when Windows Notepad would just insert the Date/Time when you pressed F5?  Well, it still does.

Problem is, Visual Studio Code doens't have this feature built-in.  Install this extension to correct this deficiency.  ;)

After that, the keybinding is up to you!

## Installation
> Ctrl + Shift + P
> ext install larrydanna.insertdatetime
 
**Enjoy!**
